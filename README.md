# Pong
This game is a two player game that is played by live players. 
The number of points the game is up to can be changed in the main method of the Pong class (Line 16). 
Once you run the code, further instructions will appear in a new window along with the game. Have fun :)
The color of the ball varies with its speed. 
The language that is used is java so make a new project in any java development IDE such as Eclipse and import all these files into that project.
It is recommended that the java interface is fully updated.
